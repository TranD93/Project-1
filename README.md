# Project-1
New cars are a tempting option to consider when replacing your old vehicle or planning to add to your toys in the garage. New cars are often easier to finance and usually come with the latest tech and safety features. However, whatever way you tend to look at it, purchasing a new automobile is generally not a sound financial decision.

Whether you’re into used cars or new ones, each category possesses their individual benefits and shortcomings. Most people tend to buy used cars for the obvious advantages used cars bring like Lesser Depreciation rate compared to new cars, Worry Less About Minor Damages, Used cars have it while new cars dont , pay lesser insurance etc. But being in 21st century, global warming has been on the front page of news on many days. Burning fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. The buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases like methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) is causing the Earth’s atmosphere to warm, resulting in changes to the climate we are already starting to see today. CO2 levels have already passed that critical number 350 ppm in May 1986. Since then there has been an increase in CO2 levels everyday. 

Hence for this project, with the data that we have have, our team has chosen the topic to address the big question. 

**Which car brand is the least harmful to our environment looking at their engine and gas consumption?**

With tables with data from year 2000 - 2022, we have enough data to come to a reasonable conclusion. The big question also opens to many other questions:

Which country manufactures the car brands that pollute our air the most?
Which brand is the most healthy for the environment ?
Is there a corelation between engine size and emissions?
Comparison between different countries cars manufacturers and their emission levels.

With the help of python, we have addressed these questions and come to a reasonable conclusion.
